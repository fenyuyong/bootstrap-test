    <h1>About Real Food</h1>
    <p>
    <em>Inspired</em> by ShakeShack (US), In-N-Out (US), Grill’d (Australia), GBK (UK) and the likes, we decided that Malaysia needed its own version too. So, we started with one simple objective. Sell a really good, juicy burger on a fresh bun. No shortcuts.
    </p>

    <p>
    From day one, we believed that the best salesman is our customer. Treat that person right, he’ll walk out of the door and sell for you. We wanted people to know that we put all our money into the food. We don’t spend our money on décor or on advertisements. But we’ll splurge on food. Our charcoal buns are baked from scratch in our own bakery daily. It’s the only way to get that perfect combination of crisp crust and melt-in-your-mouth, fresh-from-the-oven taste. We grind our own beef patties daily and hand-pack them just so they retain their freshness and juiciness. In fact, our patties are still beautifully pink right before they hit the griddle.
